    Assignment: Homework #1: Queue<Anon>

DESCRIPTION:
    This code has the ability to create a double-linked queue. This queue can be parsed and edited from both the head->tail direction and the tail->head direction.

HOW-TO-BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Type "make clean" to clear away unnecessary files.
    3. Type "make run" to compile and run the code simmultaneously.
        3.1 Running the code this way will take you through the testing sweet which prints to the terminal whether a test has passed or failed.
    4. If it is needed to run valgrind, typing "make valgrind" will run the tests as normal before running a valgrind check and printing the results.

ERRORS:
    From my personal testing, everything works as expected and every situation should be handled properly.
